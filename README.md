# TOP-library
This project is a simple Library application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to add books, display them as cards, and remove books from the library. Each book is represented as a JavaScript object and stored in an in-memory collection.
## Purpose 
The main goal of this project was to practice JavaScript object manipulation and understand how data structures interact with the DOM.

Specifically, this project helped me learn:
1. How to store objects inside arrays
2. How to add and remove objects dynamically
3. How to generate and update DOM elements based on data
4. The difference between updating data and updating the UI
5. How to use event delegation for dynamically created elements
## Technologies used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript (Vanilla)
